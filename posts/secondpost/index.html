      Hello! I just wanted to write a blog post so I can set out what I am
      looking to achieve in the first few weeks of doing this. I've recently
      completed Codecademy's Learn Swift Course Fundamentals, this allowed me to
      refresh my memory on super fundemental stuff in Swift (and also understand
      computational practices a little more :-)) I will be following some Design
      + Code tutorials to get up to grips with the latest Xcode features and the
      best practices for Swift UI. I found this platform to be the most useful
      to me, due to the combination between Figma, JS and Swift tutorials that
      is available on the platform. Tasks for the next week, w/c Dec 4th 2023: •
      Design and code a welcome screen for my Water Tracking app. • Design and
      code a new member settings page. I am really excited to get going and
      share my progress!! Vlad • Dec 3rd 2023 • Holloway, England
